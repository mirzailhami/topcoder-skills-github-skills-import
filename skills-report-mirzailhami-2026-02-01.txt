  Skill ID: 00038ad8-9bd1-47b4-8477-256e214a9f82
  Skill Name: UI/UX Research
  Score: 88
  Why: The repo heavily uses React UI libraries such as @radix-ui/react-alert-dialog, framer-motion, tailwindcss (via @tailwindcss/vite) and many .tsx/.ts files, showing a focus on user‑interface design. See the front‑end commit https://github.com/mirzailhami/ai-video-frontend/commit/c9d1f61c3797ce2b1af51636788d7588bd9ebb61.

Skill ID: 018202b0-3f2a-421d-a773-0b03ab37e373
  Skill Name: Hybrid Cloud Computing
  Score: 84
  Why: Dependencies include boto3, botocore, awscli and awsebcli, indicating integration with AWS services while the application also runs on Docker/Gunicorn, a typical hybrid cloud stack. Evidence in the backend commit https://github.com/mirzailhami/ai-video-backend/commit/bf503d1f0c4ddfdba0f847ee8830cf05d33c58b8.

  Skill Name: Middleware
  Score: 80
  Why: FastAPI (fastapi==0.115.0) serves as an API layer between the React front‑end and AWS resources, acting as middleware. The pull request https://github.com/mirzailhami/ai-code-reviewer/pull/3 shows API endpoints connecting to external services.
